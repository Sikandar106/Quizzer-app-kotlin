Quizzer Kotlin App


This is quizzer app where user guess the answer and get rewarded if the answer is correct.
This is app is all about increasing the knowlegde of user and also its fun to play this game because this app also react like a game.
This app is generating list of question and never make their user get bored while playing it.


Conlusion:
The Purpose for making this app is to getting knowledge about firebase and how data can manage on Firebase and How to retrive data from firebase into an APP.
I also get the knowledge of how to write the clean code with green check on top of the screen and make it more reusable code for future use.
It was a fun to writing this app on google introduced language called Kotlin.
It is a native app without any artifical flavours.
